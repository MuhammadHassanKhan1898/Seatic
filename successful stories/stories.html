    <p class="card-text">"Awareness is a key ingredient in success. 
        It is our awareness more than our work effort that gets the right result right now."Mark Victor Hansen The above quote completely describes my success. And my succes is the selection in the world wide known institute,IBA (Institute of business Administration) Karachi.I was always the topper through out my school and college life. But still, my goals were the same as others. As most of my classmates wanted to become either doctor or engineer. So was I. Now when I think back, I find a reason of why everyone wanted to become eithet doctor or engineer.
           It's Awareness. We only had sufficient information about medical and engineering institutions. We were lacking the awareness about the world beyond medicine and engineering.
             All we needed was either a person, any academic organisation or some awareness sessions to help achieve greatness in the fields other than medicine and engineering. I was in the second year of my college when I heard of SEATIC. There was an awareness session organised by SEATIC.
         I attended the session and first time, I heard of IBA Karachi and many other amazing universities. Since I belong to a lower middle class family, so it was not possible for me to study in such expensive institutes. But during the session, SEATIC also elaborated theTHP (Talent Hunt Program). A scholarship program for studying in IBA, Karachi.
            Now I had enough awareness, I only had to prepare for the test. But SEATIC helped me in that too. It conducted a MCQ test patterned with IBA entry test. It gets easier to achieve anything when you have enough information/ awareness about that thing.
         Since Seatic provided me all the information, thus the selection became much easier for me.</p>

    <div class="circle"> <img src="./images/sheri.jpg" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></div>
    <p class="card-text">Hey guys, I am Prem Singh Rajput, studying BBA at Sukkur IBA.
      Obviously, I was merely an average student. Awareness was key bullet for that I felt success. Awareness in a way of getting admissions in leading institutes of Pakistan through scholarships.
      So, the question is how did I get awareness? It was because of multiple awareness sessions arranged by team SEATIC in different colleges and academic centres. 
      There are many of my friends and classmates,  who,  I believe,  could have achieved those scholarships but they didn't even tried. They were stuck in their future goals rather than changing their mind. They were ignoring the sessions and stuck in their comfort zones. I would like to advise freshers of attending sessions carefully,  then they can weigh their goals. 
      I am so much thankful of the organization which cares its trustees. I am with them.</p>
